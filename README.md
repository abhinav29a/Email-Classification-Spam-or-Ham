# Email-Classification-Spam-or-Ham
  This work is the part of mini project done in the course “Information Retrieval”. In this, we developed a Naive Bayes classifier for classifying the E-mail is Spam or Ham message and the dataset we used is taken from the link [here](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/).
  
  Finally, we calculated the F1-measure and accuracy of the model based on the true positives as performance metrics and the accuracy we got is 60.5 %.
